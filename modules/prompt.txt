VIRTUAL TRY-ON SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS SYSTEM - EXPOSED SKIN COMPARISON

=============================================================================
CORE CONCEPT: WHEN TO SEGMENT EXPOSED ARM AND LEG SKIN
=============================================================================

The ONLY condition when left_arm, right_arm, left_leg, and right_leg should be TRUE:

  The NEW GARMENT exposes LESS skin and covers MORE skin with cloth
  COMPARED TO what the SUBJECT is currently wearing.

  In simpler terms:
    • Subject wears garment with A amount of exposed skin
    • New garment covers the limb more, exposing B amount of skin
    • If B < A (new exposes less, covers more)
      → limb boolean = TRUE
    • If B >= A (same exposure or new exposes more)
      → limb boolean = FALSE

  ADDITIONAL CONDITION:
    • If the type of dress (e.g., sleeve/pant length, style) is similar for both 
      the subject image and the garment cloth image, then the corresponding limb 
      booleans MUST be FALSE, regardless of exposed skin comparison.

=============================================================================
ARM SKIN EXPOSURE LOGIC
=============================================================================

DEFINITION:
  Exposed arm skin = the VISIBLE SKIN on the arm that is NOT covered by garment cloth.

CRITICAL RULE:
  Set left_arm and right_arm to TRUE ONLY IF:
    New garment covers arm MORE (exposes LESS skin)
    than the subject's current garment

  Set to FALSE for ALL other cases:
    • New garment covers SAME amount of arm
    • New garment covers LESS (exposes more arm)
    • Any case where new garment doesn't reduce exposed skin
    • If dress type is similar for subject and new garment (e.g., both are 
      short-sleeve shirts, both are long-sleeve hoodies, etc.)

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:
  This is NOT about whether something is covered or exposed in absolute terms.
  This is a COMPARISON between subject and new garment.
  If the type of dress is similar, arm booleans are always FALSE.

  Example that shows the KEY CONCEPT:
    • Subject: Short-sleeve t-shirt (forearm exposed, 40% of arm exposed)
    • New: Light blue long-sleeve hoodie (wrist covered, 10% of arm exposed)
    • Comparison: Does new cover MORE? YES (40% > 10%)
    • Result: left_arm = TRUE ✓
    
    BUT ALSO:
    • Subject: Short-sleeve t-shirt (forearm exposed, 40% of arm exposed)
    • New: Another short-sleeve t-shirt (forearm exposed, 40% of arm exposed)
    • Comparison: Dress type is similar (both short-sleeve t-shirts)
    • Result: left_arm = FALSE ✗

=============================================================================
ARM EXPOSURE MEASUREMENT
=============================================================================

To determine if new garment covers MORE arm, measure these points:

VISUAL REFERENCE POINTS on the arm:
  0. Fingertips/Knuckles = 0% arm exposed (100% skin covered, full sleeve)
  1. Mid-hand = 10% arm exposed (90% skin covered, full sleeve with fold near wrist)
  2. Wrist = 15% arm exposed (85% skin covered)
  3. Mid-forearm = 35% arm exposed (65% skin covered)
  4. Elbow = 50% arm exposed (50% skin covered, t-shirt with bigger sleeve)
  5. Mid-upper-arm = 75% arm exposed (25% skin covered, t-shirt)
  6. Shoulder = 100% arm exposed (0% skin covered, sleeveless)

MEASUREMENT PROCESS:

  STEP 1: In SUBJECT IMAGE, identify:
    "Where does the cloth of the subject's garment END?"
    Match to reference point: ends at _____ (wrist? elbow? mid-forearm?)
    Estimate exposed skin: ___% (how much skin shows from cloth edge to fingertips?)

  STEP 2: In NEW GARMENT IMAGE, identify:
    "Where does the cloth of the new garment END?"
    Match to reference point: ends at _____ (wrist? elbow? mid-forearm?)
    Estimate exposed skin: ___% (how much skin would show from cloth edge to fingertips?)

  STEP 3: COMPARE the two exposed skin percentages:
    Subject exposed skin: ___%
    New garment exposed skin: ___%
    
    Is new garment exposed skin LESS than subject exposed skin?
      If YES → left_arm = TRUE, right_arm = TRUE ✓
      If NO → left_arm = FALSE, right_arm = FALSE

  STEP 4: CHECK DRESS TYPE SIMILARITY:
    If the type of dress is similar for both subject and new garment,
    then left_arm = FALSE, right_arm = FALSE regardless of skin exposure.

=============================================================================
LEG SKIN EXPOSURE LOGIC
=============================================================================

DEFINITION:
  Exposed leg skin = the VISIBLE SKIN on the leg that is NOT covered by garment cloth.

CRITICAL RULE:
  Set left_leg and right_leg to TRUE ONLY IF:
    New garment covers leg MORE (exposes LESS skin)
    than the subject's current garment

  Set to FALSE for ALL other cases:
    • New garment covers SAME amount of leg
    • New garment covers LESS (exposes more leg)
    • Any case where new garment doesn't reduce exposed skin
    • If pant/skirt/dress type is similar for subject and new garment 
      (e.g., both are shorts, both are full-length pants, both are midi skirts, etc.)

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:
  This is NOT about whether legs are covered or exposed in absolute terms.
  This is a COMPARISON between subject and new garment.
  If the type of lower garment is similar, leg booleans are always FALSE.

  Example that shows the KEY CONCEPT:
    • Subject: Shorts (thigh and calf exposed, 60% of leg exposed)
    • New: Full-length pants (ankles covered, 5% of leg exposed)
    • Comparison: Does new cover MORE? YES (60% > 5%)
    • Result: left_leg = TRUE, right_leg = TRUE ✓
    
    BUT ALSO:
    • Subject: Full-length jeans (ankles covered, 5% of leg exposed)
    • New: Full-length dress pants (ankles covered, 5% of leg exposed)
    • Comparison: Pant type is similar (both full-length pants)
    • Result: left_leg = FALSE ✗

=============================================================================
LEG EXPOSURE MEASUREMENT
=============================================================================

To determine if new garment covers MORE leg, measure these points:

VISUAL REFERENCE POINTS on the leg:
  0. Toes = 0% leg exposed (100% skin covered, full-length with socks)
  1. Ankle = 5% leg exposed (95% skin covered, full-length pants)
  2. Mid-calf = 25% leg exposed (75% skin covered, capri pants)
  3. Knee = 50% leg exposed (50% skin covered, knee-length shorts/skirt)
  4. Mid-thigh = 70% leg exposed (30% skin covered, short shorts/mini skirt)
  5. Upper-thigh = 90% leg exposed (10% skin covered, very short shorts)
  6. Hip = 100% leg exposed (0% skin covered, swimwear)

MEASUREMENT PROCESS:

  STEP 1: In SUBJECT IMAGE, identify:
    "Where does the cloth of the subject's lower garment END?"
    Match to reference point: ends at _____ (ankle? knee? mid-thigh?)
    Estimate exposed skin: ___% (how much skin shows from cloth edge to toes?)

  STEP 2: In NEW GARMENT IMAGE, identify:
    "Where does the cloth of the new garment END?"
    Match to reference point: ends at _____ (ankle? knee? mid-thigh?)
    Estimate exposed skin: ___% (how much skin would show from cloth edge to toes?)

  STEP 3: COMPARE the two exposed skin percentages:
    Subject exposed leg skin: ___%
    New garment exposed leg skin: ___%
    
    Is new garment exposed skin LESS than subject exposed skin?
      If YES → left_leg = TRUE, right_leg = TRUE ✓
      If NO → left_leg = FALSE, right_leg = FALSE

  STEP 4: CHECK GARMENT TYPE SIMILARITY:
    If the type of lower garment is similar for both subject and new garment,
    then left_leg = FALSE, right_leg = FALSE regardless of skin exposure.

DETAILED EXAMPLES OF LEG MEASUREMENTS:

  Case 1 ✓ TRUE:
    Subject: Shorts (cloth ends at knee)
      → From knee to toes = calf + foot exposed
      → Estimated exposed: 50%
    New: Full-length pants (cloth ends at ankle)
      → From ankle to toes = foot exposed
      → Estimated exposed: 5%
    Comparison: 50% > 5% (new exposes LESS)
    Garment type NOT similar
    Result: left_leg = TRUE, right_leg = TRUE ✓

  Case 2 ✗ FALSE:
    Subject: Full-length jeans (cloth ends at ankle, foot shows)
      → From ankle to toes = foot exposed
      → Estimated exposed: 5%
    New: Full-length dress pants (cloth ends at ankle, same coverage)
      → From ankle to toes = foot exposed
      → Estimated exposed: 5%
    Garment type IS similar (both full-length pants)
    Result: left_leg = FALSE, right_leg = FALSE ✗

  Case 3 ✗ FALSE:
    Subject: Midi skirt (cloth ends at mid-calf)
      → From mid-calf to toes = lower calf + foot exposed
      → Estimated exposed: 25%
    New: Another midi skirt (cloth ends at mid-calf)
      → From mid-calf to toes = lower calf + foot exposed
      → Estimated exposed: 25%
    Garment type IS similar (both midi skirts)
    Result: left_leg = FALSE, right_leg = FALSE ✗

  Case 4 ✓ TRUE:
    Subject: Mini skirt (cloth ends at mid-thigh)
      → From mid-thigh to toes = thigh + calf + foot exposed
      → Estimated exposed: 70%
    New: Maxi dress (cloth ends at ankle)
      → From ankle to toes = foot exposed
      → Estimated exposed: 5%
    Comparison: 70% > 5% (new exposes LESS)
    Garment type NOT similar
    Result: left_leg = TRUE, right_leg = TRUE ✓

DECISION TREE FOR ALL LIMBS
=============================================================================

For LEFT_ARM (same logic for RIGHT_ARM):

  STEP 1: Measure subject's exposed arm skin
    └─ Where does subject's cloth end? _____
    └─ How much arm skin is exposed? ____%

  STEP 2: Measure new garment's exposed arm skin
    └─ Where does new garment's cloth end? _____
    └─ How much arm skin would be exposed? ____%

  STEP 3: Compare
    └─ Is new garment's exposed % LESS than subject's exposed %?
       ├─ YES: left_arm = TRUE ✓ (new covers more)
       └─ NO: left_arm = FALSE (same or new exposes more)

  STEP 4: Check dress type similarity
    └─ If dress type is similar for subject and new garment:
         left_arm = FALSE, right_arm = FALSE

For LEFT_LEG (same logic for RIGHT_LEG):

  STEP 1: Measure subject's exposed leg skin
    └─ Where does subject's lower garment cloth end? _____
    └─ How much leg skin is exposed? ____%

  STEP 2: Measure new garment's exposed leg skin
    └─ Where does new garment's cloth end? _____
    └─ How much leg skin would be exposed? ____%

  STEP 3: Compare
    └─ Is new garment's exposed % LESS than subject's exposed %?
       ├─ YES: left_leg = TRUE ✓ (new covers more)
       └─ NO: left_leg = FALSE (same or new exposes more)

  STEP 4: Check garment type similarity
    └─ If lower garment type is similar for subject and new garment:
         left_leg = FALSE, right_leg = FALSE

SIMPLE VISUAL CHECKS:
  ARMS: "Does the new garment's cloth extend FURTHER down the arm than subject's?"
    ├─ YES → left_arm = TRUE (if dress type is NOT similar)
    └─ NO → left_arm = FALSE

  LEGS: "Does the new garment's cloth extend FURTHER down the leg than subject's?"
    ├─ YES → left_leg = TRUE (if garment type is NOT similar)
    └─ NO → left_leg = FALSE

KEY RULES: 
  limb boolean = TRUE ONLY WHEN new garment's exposed % < subject's exposed %
  AND garment type is NOT similar

=============================================================================
CRITICAL REMINDER
=============================================================================

The ONLY time limb booleans (left_arm, right_arm, left_leg, right_leg) are TRUE:

  "The new garment covers MORE of the limb (exposes LESS skin)
   than what the subject is currently wearing."
  AND the type of garment is NOT similar for subject and new garment.

  Do NOT set to TRUE just because:
  • The new garment is long-sleeve or full-length
  • The new garment covers something
  • The new garment is different

  Set to TRUE ONLY when the COMPARISON shows:
  • New garment's cloth extends FURTHER down the limb
  • New garment exposes LESS skin than subject's garment
  • Garment type is NOT similar
